# Simple traffic simulation
A small project I explored to see the effect of leaving late and leaving early from work/college, given that there is usually a heavy rush on the way home.

# Requirements to run
Python 3.6

# Tech used
This was developed with WinPython-3.6.3 on Windows

# Current State
Initial project was just a small exploration, with which I got decent results. 
Further phases were planned but later dropped.
