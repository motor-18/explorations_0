# Simple traffic simulation
A small project I explored to see the effect of leaving workplace/college and time spent in traffic.

# Motivation
This project is a combination of two desires - to learn Python and to test a problem that had been nagging me.

I was one of the many who lived far from work/internship/college, and had to fight traffic to-and-fro everyday. I wanted to explore the extent by which leaving early/late would reduce the time spent in traffic. Having just started learning a new programming language (Python), I decided to try this new "skill" for this problem.

# Requirements to run
Python 3.6

# Tech used
This was developed with WinPython-3.6.3 on Windows

# Current State
Initial project was just a small exploration, with which I got decent results. 
All code is in a single Python file.
Further phases were planned but later dropped.
The code was designed to be changed and updated with relative ease, so you may see it reflected in the function definitions.

# Technical explanation
I have the documentation on the project, unfortunately in PDF.
The documentation and problem design is ahead of the actual implementation, as I had dropped the project after Phase 1.

# Future
There are no plans to update this program as of now, however things change and the future is uncertain.
