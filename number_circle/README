This folder is for my crazy idea for a number-circle (as opposed to the ubiquitous number line). 

This folder will mostly contain PDF, as it is mostly mathematical in nature.

This is not intended to be a rigorous document; it is one simple guy's exploration of a wild idea that appeared out of nowhere...
Hence do not expect math rigor and symbols as with actual academic math papers - expect more English and less Math symbols.
